### ❑ Where does the player do it? (Setting, story, narration)

The game takes place in a cursed, labyrinthine tower filled with dangerous enemies, hidden traps, mysterious puzzles, and magical energy. The setting grows darker and more threatening as the player progresses, culminating in the final battle against Hex at the ritual site.

### ❑ How does the player do it? (Core mechanics)

The player utilizes a combination of real-time maze navigation, magic-based combat skills, and timed puzzle solving.  
Progression is measured through EXP, which unlocks new levels, and gold, which enables upgrades and purchases.
